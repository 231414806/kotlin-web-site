[//]: # (title: Participate in the Kotlin Early Access Preview)

You can participate in the Kotlin Early Access Preview (EAP) to try out the latest Kotlin features before they are released.

We ship a few Beta (_Beta_) and Release Candidate (_RC_) builds before every feature (_1.x_) and incremental (_1.x.y_) release. 

We'll be very thankful if you find and report bugs to our issue tracker [YouTrack](https://kotl.in/issue). 
It is very likely that we'll be able to fix them before the final release, which means you won't need to wait until the next Kotlin release for your issues to be addressed. 

By participating in the Early Access Preview and reporting bugs, you contribute to Kotlin and help us make it better 
for everyone in [the growing Kotlin community](https://kotlinlang.org/community/). We appreciate your help a lot! 

If you have any questions and want to participate in discussions, you are welcome to join the [#eap channel in Kotlin Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T09229ZC6/C0KLZSCHF). 
In this channel, you can also get notifications about new EAP builds.

## How the EAP can help you be more productive with Kotlin

* If you work on a multi-module complex project, participating in the EAP may streamline your experience when you adopt the Stable release version. The sooner you update to the Stable version, the sooner you will be able to take advantage of its performance improvements and new language features. However, the migration of huge and complex projects might take a while, not only because of their size but also because some specific use cases may not have been covered yet by the Kotlin team. By participating in the EAP and continuously testing new versions of Kotlin, you will be able to provide us with feedback about your specific use cases as early as possible. This will help us address as many issues as possible, and give you peace of mind about updating to the Stable version when itâ€™s released. [Check out how Slack benefits from testing Android, Kotlin, and Gradle pre-release versions](https://slack.engineering/shadow-jobs/).
* Updating to the new Kotlin version is extremely important for library authors, as using older versions could block your users from updating Kotlin in their projects. Working with EAP versions allows you to support the latest Kotlin versions in your library almost immediately with the Stable release, which will make your users happier and will contribute to your library's popularity.
* Finally, if you are a Kotlin enthusiast and enjoy contributing to the Kotlin ecosystem by creating educational content, trying new features in the Kotin EAP could allow you to be among the first to share the experience of using the new cool features with the community.
